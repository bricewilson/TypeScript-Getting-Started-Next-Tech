## Working with the lab files

The lab includes two versions of the demo project. The files inside the "Start" folder contain the files as they exist at the beginning of the course. Use these files if you would like to code along with the course. The files inside the "Finish" folder contain the files as they exist at the end of the course.

The contents of the "package.json" file and the "webpack.config.js" files are slightly different from the files available in the course download materials in order to support the functionality in the lab environment.

1. In the terminal, change to the folder containing the code you want to run. For example, switch to the "Start" folder with the command `cd Start`.

2. Run the command `npm start` to copile the TypeScript code with Webpack which will produce a file named "bundle.js" in the "app" folder.

3. Switch to a web browser tab inside the lab environment.

4. The browser will initially show you the "index.html" file at the root of the lab environment. Click the link on that page to visit the app in either the "Start" or "Finish" folders.
